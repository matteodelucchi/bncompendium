# Glosary
_Greedy Algorithm_: Used in optimization problems. Tries to approximate the overall optimal way to solve a problem by making step-wise optimal choices.

_Canonical Form_: Normal, standard way of describing a mathematical object. 

_Latent Variable_: Variable that is inferred from other variables. Not directly observed.

_Parameteric Model_: A statistical model that has all it's information represented in its parameters. Those are the only thing needed to predict future or unknown values.

_Oracle Property_: An oracle knows the truth: it knows the true subset and is willing to act on it. The oracle property is that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is the same as the asymptotic distribution of the MLE on only the true support. That is, the estimator adapts to knowing the true support without paying a price (in terms of the asymptotic distribution.)
